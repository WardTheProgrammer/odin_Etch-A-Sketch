Etch A Sketch

A drawing program on a grid, which begins at 16x16 but can be edited to any size up to 100x100. You can draw using your mouse and clicking turns of the drawing and the drawing is turned on again when clicked for the second time. The clear button colors the grid white, the random button makes the pen draw random colors and the eraser button makes the pen draw white. The random and eraser buttons are turned of when the other button is clicked or when the button is clicked for the second time.
This project is coded in HTML, CSS and JS.
I would like to add a slowly darkening button, which increases the darkness of the color in the square by 10%.

You can run the website by using the html previewer of GitHub or by going to my portfolio, which is on my GitHub, and clicking on the link there.
